{"name":"Uglyunitconverter","tagline":"An ugly unit converter.","body":"### Welcome to UglyUnitConverter.\r\nThis project was initially started to give me a handy unit conversion program that functioned the way I wanted. I also decided to use it as another avenue to learning/practicing programming. To make it a little more robust than it started, I decided to make a class for each type of unit (linear, area...) and instantiate a value object that could return the value in any of the other units currently in the class. These classes are stored in a separate DLL so that they can be easily used in other projects.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
